Display currently played song of an AzuraCast instance in a sidebar.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a widget to your WordPress sidebar showing the currently played song of a AzuraCast station by their public API. You're able to configure whether to display the album, title, artist, artwork and player links.
Important: By version 2.0.0 you need to use the station shortcode instead of station id. It's necessary because AzuraCast's Live Now-Playing Api won't support station ids. You need to enable websocket support in your AzuraCast Instance.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to your WordPress plugins directory, e.g. '/wp-content/plugins/plugins/'.
2. Enable the plugin pressing 'Activate'.
3. Add and configure the widget under 'Appearance' -> 'Widgets'.
